Preprocessing of functional MRI (ASL) involves numerous steps to clean and standardize
the data before statistical analysis.
Generally, researchers create ad hoc preprocessing workflows for each dataset,
building upon a large inventory of available tools.
The complexity of these workflows has snowballed with rapid advances in
acquisition and processing.
ASLPrep is an analysis-agnostic tool that addresses the challenge of robust and
reproducible preprocessing for task-based and resting ASL data.
ASLPrep automatically adapts a best-in-breed workflow to the idiosyncrasies of
virtually any dataset, ensuring high-quality preprocessing without manual intervention.
ASLPrep robustly produces high-quality results on diverse ASL data.
Additionally, ASLPrep introduces less uncontrolled spatial smoothness than observed
with commonly used preprocessing tools.
ASLPrep equips neuroscientists with an easy-to-use and transparent preprocessing
workflow, which can help ensure the validity of inference and the interpretability
of results.
